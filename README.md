üëã **Welcome in!** üëã

This repository contains the Open Source code for [gliff.ai](https://gliff.ai)‚Äôs [Browserstack Automate tests using Jest](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/jest-framework-tutorial).

This [test] repository aims to create vital tests which help catch any technical or visual breakages in the code or performance and alert the [gliff.ai](https://gliff.ai) team. This simple test harness is a collection of stubs, driver and other support tools that enables Browserstack Automate tests to be run with Jest and generate a test report.

‚ùå **This repository does not accept most contributions unfortunately! However, an issue can still be raised if you recognise a problem you wish to bring to the gliff.ai teams attention.** ‚ùå

## Setup

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

Below is the wrapper you should use to setup **BrowerStack** and run Selenium tests using Jest.

```javascript
// Replaces the Jest global `test` with our function, which has a selenium driver as an arg. This handles sending pass/failure status to Browserstack.
const {
  wrapper,
  test,
  webdriver,
} = require("@gliff-ai/jest-browserstack-automate")();

const { TARGET_URL = "http://localhost:3000/" } = process.env;

// Wrappper is a jest describe with before/after hooks to setup browserstack and the local tunnel
wrapper(() => {
  describe("Load page", () => {
    test("Loads the page", async (driver, percySnapshot) => {
      await driver.get(TARGET_URL);

      await driver.wait(webdriver.until.titleMatches(/Title/i), 5000);
      const title = await driver.getTitle();

      expect(title).toEqual("PAGE TITLE");
    });
  });
});

```

run with `jest --no-colors` as we send the message to browserstack so don't want the colour codes.

**NOTE:** \
If no env vars are set, it will run locally, you will need the driver installed for the selected browser. \
If BROWSERSTACK_NAME is set, it will use Browserstack for the driver (capabilities can be passed as the final arg to `test`). \
If BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY is set, the Browserstack local proxy will be set up, which allows the use of local URLs. \

Below is the additonal wrapper you should use to setup **Percy**.

The second argument passed to `test` is a wrapper for percySnapshot that will create only 1 snapshot rather than 1 for each browser (import the original from "@percy/selenium-webdriver" to create a snapshot for every browser)

`PERCY_TOKEN=xxxx percy exec -- jest --no-colors`
